#dpird-wf
Workflows for the assembly, mapping and blast analysis of illumina sequencing data - for the purpose of pathogen discovery and the assembly of diploid organisms.

This is a project for porting existing workflows into Zeus (@pawsey.org.au) on an all-open source software stack and builds on an exiting dpird-mk_GitHub workflow.

#dpird-wf
Workflows for the assembly, mapping and blast analysis of illumina sequencing data - for the purpose of pathogen discovery and the assembly of diploid organisms.
 
This is a project for porting existing workflows into Zeus ([@pawsey.org.au](https://pawsey.org.au])) on an all-open source software stack and builds on the exiting [dpird-mk_GitHub](https://github.com/PawseySC/dpird-mk) workflow.
